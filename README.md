This project allows young people to use simple words or phrases that describe artworks that are inspired by these words that may be housed by the Metropolitan museum of Art.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has a tremendous collection of artwork from around the world and across the years. However, we might not always remember the names of the artwork we want to see. Using a simple form submission, users can access the Met's extensive collections API, and receive random images of artworks inspired by or containing their search phrase. A placeholder image is supplied if the phrase does not appear in the database search.

Optimizations

Although I desired to keep this design simple and clean and let the artwork do the talking, I would perhaps build out the styling a little more. At a later date I'd like to include other databases that could supplement any search parameters that might not return a result.

Examples:
Take a look at other examples that I have in my own portfolio:
